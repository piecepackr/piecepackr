Author: Trevor L Davis. 
Maintainer: Trevor L Davis <trevor.l.davis@gmail.com>
Description: This is an R package designed to make configurable piecepack graphics. It includes some executable Rscripts designed to make a "Print & Play" pdf of piecepack components as well as an Rscript to build images of individual components. The API can also be used with the grid R package to make piecepack diagrams (i.e. for inclusion in rulesets) or even to make a custom Print & Play layout.
