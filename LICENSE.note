piecepackr includes the following components from other projects:

* The outline for the meeple shape used in the "meeples" configuration (also used in some face cards in the playing cards configurations) was extracted (converted into a dataset of normalized x, y coordinates) from `Meeple icon <https://game-icons.net/1x1/delapouite/meeple.html>`_ by `Delapouite <https://delapouite.com/>`_ / `CC BY 3.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/>`_.  Since "simple shapes" nor data can be copyrighted under American law this meeple outline is not copyrightable in the United States.  However, in other legal jurisdictions with stricter copyright laws you may need to give the proper CC BY attribution if you use any of the meeples.

* `extdata/by-sa.svgz` is a Creative Commons License "button mark" from https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-assets made available under the following license (https://creativecommons.org/policies):
